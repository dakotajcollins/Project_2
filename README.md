We will be taking our data from fbref.com which is a website that has different datasets on Soccer teams in several different leagues. Our team has decided to focus on the La Liga league. We will each pull data from different seasons from the Player Standards Stats table and join them on the League Table on the column Squad. We will perform some transformations on the tables and migrate it to a single non-relational database in MongoDB.

Our data sources are going to come from the following seasons:
 •	2017-2018 - https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/1652/2017-2018-La-Liga-Stats
 •	2018-2019 - https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/1886/2018-2019-La-Liga-Stats
 •	2019-2020 - https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/3239/2019-2020-La-Liga-Stats
 •	2020-2021 - https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/10731/2020-2021-La-Liga-Stats
